# Library Management System - DBMS Assignment

This project showcases the design and implementation of a **Library Management System (LMS)** using relational database principles.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to design a robust and efficient system to manage various operations of a digital library, including member registration, book issuance, fine calculation, and supplier management. This project simulates a real-world LMS with practical SQL implementation and normalization techniques.

## Components

- **Database Design**: Consists of five core tables:
  - `LMS_MEMBERS`
  - `LMS_SUPPLIERS_DETAILS`
  - `LMS_FINE_DETAILS`
  - `LMS_BOOK_DETAILS`
  - `LMS_BOOK_ISSUE`

- **SQL Queries**: A set of optimized SQL queries demonstrating:
  - Data retrieval and aggregation
  - Join operations
  - Grouping and filtering
  - Performance-based logic like top issuers and fine calculations

- **ER Diagram**: Visual representation of table relationships.

- **Data Dictionary**: Metadata details for each table.

- **Normalization**: Demonstrated normalization to 3NF to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency.

## Key Concepts Applied

- Relational Schema Design
- Entity-Relationship Modelling
- SQL Query Design
- Functional Dependencies
- First, Second, and Third Normal Forms
- Real-world DBMS application for library operations

## Files Included

- `22bce305_DBMS_Assignment.pdf`: Detailed project documentation including table structures, SQL queries, ER diagram, and normalization steps.

## Tools Used

- SQL (Standard)
- ER Diagram Tool (manual design)
- DBMS concepts and theoretical principles
